    "**The Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm**<br>\n",
    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.<br>\n",
    "My understanding of the algorithm was developed through the explanation provided in ([LibreTexts](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Coalinga_College/Math_for_Educators_(MATH_010A_and_010B_CID120)/04%3A_Number_Theory/4.03%3A_The_Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)), which illustrates the process of iteratively crossing out multiples of each prime starting from 2.\n",
    "The method continues until all non-prime numbers have been marked, leaving only prime numbers unmarked.\n",

    "**Purpose:** The `find_primes` function ([adapted from GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-program-for-sieve-of-eratosthenes/)), finds the first `n` prime numbers using a vectorized version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.<br><br>\n",
    "I decided to use this method of finding prime numbers as it is a fast and memory efficient way of generating prime numbers, particularly as the number of required primes increases.<br><br>\n",
    "When testing prime functions from\n",
    "([given documentation](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational-theory/blob/main/materials/prime_numbers.ipynb)), on larger numbers such as 90000, the time taken to return the primes was slower (6s), compared to vectorised Sieve Algorithm (0s).<br><br>\n",
    "The algorithm systematically eliminates non-prime numbers by marking multiples of each prime, and when implemented with ([NumPy vectorization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy/vectorized-operations-in-numpy/)), this marking is performed in a single optimized operation rather than in repeated Python loops, leveraging NumPy's underlying C implementation for faster and more efficient computations.\n",

    "Uses ([slice function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-slice-function/)) to set 0 and 1 to False as they are not primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(k)) + 1):**<br>\n",
    "Loops through every number from 2 up to square root of `k`. Any non-prime number will have at least one factor less than or equal to its square root, so checking beyond this point is unnecessary.\n",
