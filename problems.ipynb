    "\n",
    "In this problem, we implement the core logical and bitwise operations defined in the Secure Hash Standard for the SHA-256 algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations - Parity, Ch, Maj, Σ₀, Σ₁, σ₀, and σ₁ - are applied repeatedly during each round of the SHA-256 compression function to introduce variation, randomness and non-linearity, which is important in cryptographic security.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure correctness and match the behaviour described in the standard, all computations are performed using NumPy 32-bit integers.\n",
    "This guarantees that operations such as bitwise shifts, rotates, and modular additions behave exactly as they do in SHA-256, where every value must remain within a 32-bit word.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these functions, we get a clear idea of how SHA-256 performs its basic logical operations.\n",
    "We also need these functions later in Problems 3 and 4, where they are used during block processing and hash calculation."

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**<br>\n",
    "Before the message block can be processed, it must be padded to ensure that its length is a multiple of 512 bits (64 bytes). Padding is accomplished by adding a 1-bit followed by as many 0-bits as necessary to achieve the desired length. The length of the original message is also appended to the end of the padded message, expressed as a 64-bit binary number. ([padding explanation](https://enlear.academy/blockchain-deep-dive-into-sha-256-secure-hash-algorithm-256-bit-824ac0e90b24)).<br>\n",
    "This ensures the message is in the correct format to be split into 512-bit blocks and processed safely by the hashing algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the function is doing:**<br>\n",
    "1. **no_bits = 0:**\n",
    "Initialising the counter storing how many bits of the original message have been read.\n",
    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "2. **for block in file_to_blocks(filepath):**<br>\n",
    "Read the file in 64-byte chunks using the generator `file_to_blocks`.\n",
    "    * **no_bits = no_bits + (len(block) * 8):**<br>\n",
    "Count the number of bits in each block and add to the total.\n",
    "    * **if len(block) == 64: yield block:**<br>\n",
    "If the block is a full 64 bytes, yield it immediately.\n",
    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "3.  **if no_bits == 0: block = bytes():**<br>\n",
    "If the file is empty `byte()` creates an empty block so the padding logic can still run. \n",
